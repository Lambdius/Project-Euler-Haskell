### Project Euler *( Haskell )*

A repository for the practice of Haskell programming, since pure functional languages are better suited for computational tasks than for application building tasks, I decided to take the tasks from the Euler project.

> Haskell is not my main programming language, therefore, the solutions will not be the best.

#### Tasks:
0. Need to solve 50+ tasks
1. Need to learn how to write unit tests for tasks
2. Need to convert a set files in a simple console app
